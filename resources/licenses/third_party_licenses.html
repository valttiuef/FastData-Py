HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE<br>==========================<br><br>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting<br>Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands<br>as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python&#x27;s<br>principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.<br><br>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for<br>National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)<br>in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the<br>software.<br><br>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to<br>BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same<br>year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became<br>Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see<br>https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization<br>created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.<br>Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.<br><br>All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for<br>the Open Source Definition).

Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any<br>format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used<br>for producing a compiler intermediate representation.<br><br>The &quot;Compilation Process&quot; transforms code entirely represented in<br>non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in<br>Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code.

By contrast,<br>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>know their rights.<br><br>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br><br>  For the developers&#x27; and authors&#x27; protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#x27; and<br>authors&#x27; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>authors of previous versions.<br><br>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>protecting users&#x27; freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br><br>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>  0. Definitions.<br><br>  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br><br>  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>works, such as semiconductor masks.<br><br>  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and<br>&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.<br><br>  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the<br>earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.<br><br>  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>on the Program.<br><br>  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br><br>  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br><br>  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;<br>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br><br>  1. Source Code.<br><br>  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source<br>form of a work.<br><br>  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official<br>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>is widely used among developers working in that language.<br><br>  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other<br>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component<br>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br><br>  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all<br>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#x27;s<br>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>subprograms and other parts of the work.<br><br>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>Source.<br><br>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>same work.<br><br>  2. Basic Permissions.<br><br>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br><br>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br><br>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>makes it unnecessary.<br><br>  3. Protecting Users&#x27; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br><br>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>measures.<br><br>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#x27;s<br>users, your or third parties&#x27; legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>technological measures.<br><br>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br><br>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#x27;s source code as you<br>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br><br>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br><br>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br><br>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>    it, and giving a relevant date.<br><br>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.<br><br>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br><br>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>    work need not make them do so.<br><br>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#x27;s users<br>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>parts of the aggregate.<br><br>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br><br>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>in one of these ways:<br><br>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange.<br><br>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br><br>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>    with subsection 6b.<br><br>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br><br>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>    charge under subsection 6d.<br><br>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>included in conveying the object code work.<br><br>  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any<br>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a<br>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>the only significant mode of use of the product.<br><br>  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,<br>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>modification has been made.<br><br>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>been installed in ROM).<br><br>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>protocols for communication across the network.<br><br>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>unpacking, reading or copying.<br><br>  7. Additional Terms.<br><br>  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br><br>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br><br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br><br>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br><br>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br><br>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br><br>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>    authors of the material; or<br><br>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br><br>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>    those licensors and authors.<br><br>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further<br>restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br><br>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>where to find the applicable terms.<br><br>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>the above requirements apply either way.<br><br>  8. Termination.<br><br>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>paragraph of section 11).<br><br>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br><br>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>your receipt of the notice.<br><br>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>material under section 10.<br><br>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br><br>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br><br>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br><br>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br>  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an<br>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>licenses to the work the party&#x27;s predecessor in interest had or could<br>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br><br>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br><br>  11. Patents.<br><br>  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>work thus licensed is called the contributor&#x27;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.<br><br>  A contributor&#x27;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims<br>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant<br>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>this License.<br><br>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>patent license under the contributor&#x27;s essential patent claims, to<br>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br><br>  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express<br>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a<br>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>patent against the party.<br><br>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have<br>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>covered work in a country, or your recipient&#x27;s use of the covered work<br>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br><br>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>work and works based on it.<br><br>  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within<br>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br><br>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br><br>  12. No Surrender of Others&#x27; Freedom.<br><br>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br><br>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br><br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>combination as such.<br><br>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br><br>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the<br>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#x27;s<br>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>to choose that version for the Program.<br><br>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>later version.<br><br>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br><br>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  16. Limitation of Liability.<br><br>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br><br>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br><br>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br><br>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br>    &lt;one line to give the program&#x27;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br><br>    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>    (at your option) any later version.<br><br>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>    GNU General Public License for more details.<br><br>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br><br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br><br>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br><br>    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#x27;.<br>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>    under certain conditions; type `show c&#x27; for details.<br><br>The hypothetical commands `show w&#x27; and `show c&#x27; should show the appropriate<br>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program&#x27;s commands<br>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &quot;about box&quot;.<br><br>  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.<br>For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br><br>  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.<br><br></td>

By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>Foundation&#x27;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>rights.<br><br>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br>  Also, for each author&#x27;s protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>authors&#x27; reputations.<br><br>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>patent must be licensed for everyone&#x27;s free use or not licensed at all.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br>refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br><br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#x27;s<br>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>along with the Program.<br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>    parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Program.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br><br>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Program or works based on it.<br><br>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients&#x27; exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>this License.<br><br>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br>later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.<br><br>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br>			    NO WARRANTY<br><br>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>================================<br>Apache License 2.0<br>================================<br><br>                                 Apache License<br>                           Version 2.0, January 2004<br>                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/<br><br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<br><br>   1.

You may add Your own attribution<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>          as modifying the License.<br><br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>      the conditions stated in this License.<br><br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

You are solely responsible for determining the<br>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br><br>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br><br>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>      License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>Foundation&#x27;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>rights.<br><br>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br>  Also, for each author&#x27;s protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>authors&#x27; reputations.<br><br>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>patent must be licensed for everyone&#x27;s free use or not licensed at all.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br>refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br><br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#x27;s<br>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>along with the Program.<br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>    parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Program.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br><br>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Program or works based on it.<br><br>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients&#x27; exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>this License.<br><br>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br>later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.<br><br>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br>			    NO WARRANTY<br><br>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br><br>Apache License 2.0<br>++++++++++++++++++<br><br>                                 Apache License<br>                           Version 2.0, January 2004<br>                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/<br><br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<br><br>   1.

For the purposes<br>      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br><br>      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>      the copyright owner.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br><br>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>      meet the following conditions:<br><br>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br><br>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>          stating that You changed the files; and<br><br>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>          the Derivative Works; and<br><br>      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its<br>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>          as modifying the License.<br><br>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>      the conditions stated in this License.<br><br>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br><br>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,<br>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

By contrast,<br>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>know their rights.<br><br>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br><br>  For the developers&#x27; and authors&#x27; protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#x27; and<br>authors&#x27; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>authors of previous versions.<br><br>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>protecting users&#x27; freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br><br>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>  0. Definitions.<br><br>  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br><br>  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>works, such as semiconductor masks.<br><br>  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and<br>&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.<br><br>  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the<br>earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.<br><br>  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>on the Program.<br><br>  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br><br>  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br><br>  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;<br>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br><br>  1. Source Code.<br><br>  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source<br>form of a work.<br><br>  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official<br>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>is widely used among developers working in that language.<br><br>  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other<br>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component<br>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br><br>  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all<br>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&#x27;s<br>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>subprograms and other parts of the work.<br><br>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>Source.<br><br>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>same work.<br><br>  2. Basic Permissions.<br><br>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br><br>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br><br>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>makes it unnecessary.<br><br>  3. Protecting Users&#x27; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br><br>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>measures.<br><br>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&#x27;s<br>users, your or third parties&#x27; legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>technological measures.<br><br>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br><br>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&#x27;s source code as you<br>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br><br>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br><br>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br><br>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>    it, and giving a relevant date.<br><br>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.<br><br>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br><br>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>    work need not make them do so.<br><br>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&#x27;s users<br>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>parts of the aggregate.<br><br>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br><br>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>in one of these ways:<br><br>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange.<br><br>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br><br>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>    with subsection 6b.<br><br>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br><br>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>    charge under subsection 6d.<br><br>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>included in conveying the object code work.<br><br>  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any<br>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a<br>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>the only significant mode of use of the product.<br><br>  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,<br>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>modification has been made.<br><br>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>been installed in ROM).<br><br>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>protocols for communication across the network.<br><br>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>unpacking, reading or copying.<br><br>  7. Additional Terms.<br><br>  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br><br>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br><br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br><br>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br><br>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br><br>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br><br>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>    authors of the material; or<br><br>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br><br>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>    those licensors and authors.<br><br>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further<br>restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br><br>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>where to find the applicable terms.<br><br>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>the above requirements apply either way.<br><br>  8. Termination.<br><br>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>paragraph of section 11).<br><br>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br><br>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>your receipt of the notice.<br><br>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>material under section 10.<br><br>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br><br>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br><br>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br><br>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br>  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an<br>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>licenses to the work the party&#x27;s predecessor in interest had or could<br>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br><br>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br><br>  11. Patents.<br><br>  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>work thus licensed is called the contributor&#x27;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.<br><br>  A contributor&#x27;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims<br>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant<br>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>this License.<br><br>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>patent license under the contributor&#x27;s essential patent claims, to<br>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br><br>  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express<br>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a<br>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>patent against the party.<br><br>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have<br>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>covered work in a country, or your recipient&#x27;s use of the covered work<br>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br><br>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>work and works based on it.<br><br>  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within<br>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br><br>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br><br>  12. No Surrender of Others&#x27; Freedom.<br><br>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br><br>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br><br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>combination as such.<br><br>  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br><br>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the<br>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&#x27;s<br>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>to choose that version for the Program.<br><br>  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>later version.<br><br>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br><br>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  16. Limitation of Liability.<br><br>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br><br>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br><br>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br><br>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

            <td>A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE<br>==========================<br><br>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting<br>Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands<br>as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python&#x27;s<br>principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.<br><br>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for<br>National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)<br>in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the<br>software.<br><br>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to<br>BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same<br>year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became<br>Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see<br>https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization<br>created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.<br>Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.<br><br>All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for<br>the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python<br>releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes<br>the various releases.<br><br>    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-<br>                    from                                compatible?
